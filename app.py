    In many regions, the manual analysis of lab reports is slow, error-prone, and often hindered by the scarcity of healthcare providers. 
    This project addresses these challenges by introducing an AI-powered application designed to automate and enhance the analysis and interpretation of lab reports, reducing wait times and the anxiety associated with them.
